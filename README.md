This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

     This is another of my FreeCodeCamp project "JavaScript Calculator". Its function is basically the same as a basic virtual calculator. It was developed with ReactJs.

     I didn't use any external library to evaluate the calculations, I simply used the eval() function (remark: this function should not be used unnecessarily as it is dangerous.

     I also used external fonts like Font Awesome for the icons.

If you want you can see a [demo](https://luismgil.github.io/Calculator).
